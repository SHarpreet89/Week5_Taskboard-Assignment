# Harpreet Singh Taskboard

## Description

This project involves creating a simple Task Board to manage and track the progress of individual tasks in a project.

## User Story

As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize, I want a task board so that I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress, and track overall project progress accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The landing page displays the task board with columns representing different progress states (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed).
- Each task is color-coded to indicate its status: tasks nearing the deadline are highlighted in yellow, and overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
- A button is available to define a new task, which opens a modal dialog to enter the task title, description, and deadline date.
- Submitting the new task form saves the task properties to localStorage and updates the task board.
- Dragging a task to a different progress column updates its state accordingly and ensures the change persists after refreshing the page.
- A delete button is provided for each task, which removes the task from the task board and ensures it is not added back after refreshing.
- When the page is refreshed, the saved tasks presist.
